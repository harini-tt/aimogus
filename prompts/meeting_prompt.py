MEETING_PROMPT = """\
An emergency meeting has been called.

{meeting_context}

Players still alive: {alive_players}

The discussion is happening now. Based on everything you know — your
observations, prior conversations, and the discussion so far — contribute to
the conversation. Be strategic: share useful information, ask pointed
questions, or defend yourself if accused.

Keep your response to 1-3 sentences, like a real player would in a fast-paced
discussion. Do not narrate actions — just speak as yourself.\
